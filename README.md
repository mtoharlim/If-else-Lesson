    print("a is less than b")
print(" no sure")

for `if g < h` if inside if

```
g = 9
h = 8
if g<h:
    print("g is less than h")
else:
    if g == h:
        print("g is equal to h")
    else:
        print("g is great than h")

```
for `BMI` if inside if
```
name = "YK"
height_m = 2
weight_kg = 90

bmi = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2)
print("bmi:")
print(bmi)
if bmi < 25:
    print(name)
    print("is not overweight")
else:
    print(name)
    print("is overweight")
    
 ```
 The result is 
 - bmi: 22.5
